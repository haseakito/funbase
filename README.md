## About Funbase

![Funbase](https://github.com/haseakito/funbase/assets/107556045/7a3e01f0-35e0-4e0f-82bc-1d1bd4684960)

Funbase is a community platform for both creators and fans. Instead of subscription based business model which is not necessarily for everyone, Funbase is focused towards one time purchase to allow more users to directly engage in **getting what they want when they want**. Funbase tries to replace the existing fan club SNS and similar services such as [Fantia](https://fantia.jp/), [myfans](https://myfans.jp/), and [candfans](https://candfans.jp/).
